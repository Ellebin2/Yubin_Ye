### Work Experience
Data Scientist and Visualization Developer, Lenovo China, MBG Service Operation, Beijing, 08/2021 - 05/2022
- Developing graph computation algorithm in identify user\`s id. Gain the maximum linked sub-graph and separate possible different users with connected information.
- Building machine learning model to classify repair type of Motorola phones. Establishing linear and non-linear regression models to figure out relationships of devices\` first repair time and the overall satisfaction of services.
- Developing VAR and ARIMA models in Python to forecast future weekly satisfaction score of maintenance services, and developing live compute tools. Developing visualization report with tableau, analyzing business logic of KPI and come up with computation methods.

### Related Training
- Research Assistant in RA-Mentor Program of Economics Department, Boston University
Supervisor: Alden Porter & Elias llin

Analyzed the data of "income and project participation survey" of the US Bureau of statistics, forecasted the income trend through the random forest prediction model, and sorted the importance of influencing factors, and selects 20 important variables for subsequent variable restructuring.

Established linear regression models with income factors by combining the subdivided variables. Used unit root
test and Granger causality test to explore and test the causality between time series variables.

- Analyze Credit Data of Prosper Loan from Kaggle
Supervisor: Pinsky Eugene
Used Pandas and Numpy transformed data types, imputed missing data with randomly distributed numbers, plotted heatmap to explore variable correlations.
Used packages from Sklearn trained decision tree and random forest models to explore whether new credit grade is a better indicator of important numerical features than old one.


Performed K-means clustering to develop a new credit grade, used the elbow method to find the best K, and
evaluated its accuracy, https://github.com/Ellebin2/MET_CS_677_Data_Science/blob/main/final_yubin.ipynb

- Nanodegree of Data Analysis, Online, Udacity.com 

Evaluated the twitter dog dataset with Pandas and Numpy, designed advanced missing data imputation methods handle dirty data, used regular expression to filter unique valid values, and explored relationship between among multiple variables by with data visualization.

Used Tableau for data visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yubinye/viz/story_v4_15645896414220/story_v3
